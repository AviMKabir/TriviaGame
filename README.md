Timed Trivia Game

live demo:  https://avimkabir.github.io/TriviaGame/


# Timer based trivia game using the following:

* jQuery timers

* simple DOM manipulation

* audio players

* if then statements

* radio buttons

* bootstrap

More notes inside the code, this was a basic way to test out looping with an issue where the autoplay would not work on Chrome. 

This seems to be a common issue so it was changed to an audio player.
